# AlphaGo-for-HOIGI

In this project, we aimed to design an uncommon game named Hoigi by following the AlphaGo model. The data was self-generated by Minimax and Minimax with alpha-beta pruning algorithms. Deep Neural Network was built to train data, then implemented MTCS with the neural network to evaluate positions and select moves. Our vision is to make Hoigi more prevalent and become an AI-friendly choice among various strategy games in the world.
