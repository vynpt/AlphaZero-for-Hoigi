# AlphaGo-for-HOIGI

In this project, we aimed to design an uncommon game named Hoigi by following the AlphaGo model. The data was self-generated by Minimax and Minimax with alpha-beta pruning algorithms. Deep Neural Network was built to train data to predict whether a position is favorable or not. Our vision is to make Hoigi more prevalent and become an AI-friendly choice among various strategy games in the world.
